## Overview

This repository serves as a consolidated home for assorted build logic.
Initially this will entail this being the canonical representation for any
such scripts which can then be copied and pasted as needed into desired locations.
If warranted, a more automated means of updating the scripts will be provided.

Each script initially will be fairly self contained, so individual scripts should
include all their relevant documentation.

## Installation
